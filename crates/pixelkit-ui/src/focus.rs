//! Keyboard focus: which registered widget currently has it, and how Tab,
//! Shift-Tab and (optionally) arrow keys move it.
//!
//! [`Ui::text_field`](crate::widget::Ui::text_field)'s own doc comment used
//! to call `focused: bool` a screen's job "deliberately" — fine for one or
//! two fields, but a Settings page with a dozen of them turns into a dozen
//! bool fields and no way to move between them except a mouse click, which
//! fails a requirement that every control be keyboard-reachable.
//!
//! `Focus` fits the same shape as [`TableState`](crate::TableState): one
//! small value a screen owns, rebuilt from what actually gets drawn rather
//! than looked up by a name that could collide. There is still no widget
//! tree and no per-widget storage — a screen calls [`Focus::register`] once
//! per focusable thing, in the same order it draws them every frame, and
//! that draw-order position *is* the widget's identity for this purpose.
//! That is not a workaround standing in for a real identity system: tab
//! order is inherently positional, even in a native toolkit's own
//! accessibility tree ("the fourth field on the form"), so a call-order
//! index is the *correct* notion of identity here — unlike scroll offset or
//! table selection, which must survive a resort or a filter and so are keyed
//! by something that outlives its position.
//!
//! # The one wrinkle immediate mode adds
//!
//! How many focusable widgets exist this frame is not known until the last
//! one has registered — but a Tab press has to move focus before the first
//! one draws. [`Focus::handle_tab`] resolves movement against *last*
//! frame's count, which is the best information available, and
//! [`register`](Focus::register) reclamps against the real count as it
//! goes. In the one frame where the count actually shrinks under a stale
//! focus index, nothing matches it and focus is effectively nowhere for
//! that frame; the next call to `handle_tab` clamps the stale index into
//! the new, smaller count and focus recovers. A retained widget tree would
//! not have this wrinkle — it is the one-frame price of not having one, and
//! in practice imperceptible: field counts rarely change between frames,
//! and when they do it is because the screen just changed, which draws the
//! user's attention away from wherever focus was anyway.
//!
//! # Arrow keys are deliberately not handled by default
//!
//! Tab is unambiguous: nothing else in this toolkit gives it meaning.
//! Arrow keys are not — [`TextFieldState`](crate::TextFieldState)'s
//! Left/Right move the caret, [`TableState`](crate::TableState)'s Up/Down
//! move row selection — so `Focus` never consumes them on its own.
//! [`Focus::handle_arrows`] is here for a screen that *wants* arrows to move
//! between controls (a settings list with no text entry, say); a widget
//! that wants arrows to move among its own items only — a radio group's
//! options — is expected to do that itself, scoped to its own count, the
//! way [`Ui::tabs`](crate::widget::Ui::tabs) already owns its own selection
//! without going through this type at all.
