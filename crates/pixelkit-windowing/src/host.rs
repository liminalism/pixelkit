//! A winit host: owns the windows and their pixel buffers, forwards input,
//! tracks the scale factor, paces redraws, and presents through a
//! [`Presenter`].
//!
//! One difference from a general-purpose shell, and it matters: **Escape is
//! delivered to the application, not treated as quit.** On a keypad, Escape is
//! a working key — it abandons what is being typed. A host that closed the
//! window on it would throw away a half-entered order at a busy counter.
//!
//! The counter client is keyboard-only by design — a cashier's hands belong on
//! the keypad — but the back office is a different job done sitting down, with
//! tables to scroll and rows to pick. So the host also reports the cursor,
//! the buttons, the wheel and the modifier keys. Every one of those arrives
//! through a defaulted trait method, which is what keeps the counter client
//! from having to know they exist.
//!
//! [`run_app`] runs one window; [`run_windows`] runs several, each with its
//! own application, buffer and presenter, all sharing one event loop. Either
//! way every window behaves like the single one always did — the multi-window
//! host is the same loop over a list of slots, not a second implementation.
//!
//! Provenance: `pos-client-ui::shell` (restaurant-pos), with HiDPI and the
//! presenter seam added; see `ATTRIBUTION.md`. Moved here from
//! `pixelkit-shell` when the crate grew panes and windows.
