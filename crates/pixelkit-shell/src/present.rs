//! The presenter seam: how a finished pixel buffer reaches the window.
//!
//! The application paints into a [`WindowBuffer`]; a [`Presenter`] owns the
//! platform surface and copies the buffer onto it. Today that is softbuffer.
//! A GPU presenter would implement the same trait — first as a texture upload
//! of the same buffer (vsync'd presents for free), later as a compositor if
//! profiling ever asks for one — without touching the application.
